Announcing a new tutorial for how to set up automated tests for Node.js
---
body:

The company that I'm currently [consulting](/consulting) for has a codebase
with a large, complex front-end written in
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Not only does this codebase
actually have automated tests, but their test coverage is pretty good, and
every new feature needs to include automated tests before it can be merged.
This is _incredible_, and every software company should work like this --
sadly, very few of them do. This means that in order to do my job, I need to
know how to write and debug automated tests for Node. I've been learning how
to do this very quickly, and there have been a few stumbles and hurdles
on the way.

[I decided to take all the knowledge I've learned about automated testing
in a modern JavaScript codebase, and pull it together into one tutorial.](/tutorials/automated-tests-node/)
It is by no means exhaustive, and the JavaScript community is moving so fast
these days that most of what's in this tutorial will probably be out of date
in six months or so. But I've already found myself wishing that I had written
more notes to myself about JavaScript testing in the past, so hopefully
this blog post will help me out in the future. If you find it useful as well,
let me know!
